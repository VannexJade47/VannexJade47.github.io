                When I was 6th grade, my biggest concerns were getting through the day without getting in trouble, passing my exams, and hanging out my friends after school. I didn't haave a clear vision of my future, and I didn't fully understand 
                the importance of education and hardwork. I always thought that high school was so far and college too. But as I progressed through middle school and high school, I began to realize the importance of my education and impact it would 
                have on my future. I started to take my studies seriously and set higher academic goal of myself.

            <p> Now, first year college student, I amazed by the opportunities that lie ahead of me. I am surrounded by a diverse group of student, all with different background and experiences, and I am excited to learn from them. I understand the value 
                of a college education and the impact it will have on my future career and personal growth.

      <div class="p4">
                <p>Looking back on from 6th grade to college , I realized how much I have matured and how much I learned. I am proud of the person I have become, and I am excited for the challenges and opportunities. I am grateful for the support of my Family and Teachers who have 
                    guided me along the way, and I am determined to make the most of my college experience.

            <p>                                   
                In eight years, I envision myself achieving several significant milestones in my personal and professional life. I see myself as a successful businessperson. I have always been entrepreneurial and I have a vision for creating and managing my own business.
                I envision myself as an IT professional who is at the cutting edge of technological advancements and is making a significant impact through my work.
Lastly, in eight years, I see myself as a proud and fulfilled family man.
