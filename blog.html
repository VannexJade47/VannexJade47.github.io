            <p> In this lesson, I learned about the major technological advancements and eras in the field of computer hardware
                and electronics. This includes understanding the Mechanical Era (1642-1934) and the invention that laid the foundation 
                for computing, such as the abacus and mechanical calculators. and also I learned understanding the Vacuum Tubes era (1935-1946) technology played in early
                electronic computing system. and the Transistor Era (1947-1962) marked the shift from Vacuum Tubes to Transistor, leading to more efficient and reliable 
                electronicdevices and the Integrated Circuit Era (1963-1972) brought about the development of Integrated Circuit. In the PC & VLSI Era (1972-Present)
                I learned how to to develop of personal computers and very-large-scale integrated technologyhas had a profound impact on modern computing
                 and that all of this lesson.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="p1">
            <p1>In this lesson, I learned about the basic concepts of computer security, is it importance to protecting the data and system from unauthorized access, damage, theft,
                or other cyber threats. and also the common types of cyber-attacks and the countermeasures that can be used to prevent or mitigate them. and also I learned about the
            common types of cybercriminals, such as hackers, scammers, and cyberterrorists, and their motivations for engaging in cybercrimes. and the common types of cybercrimes such as
            malware attacks, phishing scams, identity theft,and online fraud, and how they can impact individuals and organizations. </p1>
        </div>
        <div class="p6">
            <p1>One lesson that challenged me the most was learning about JavaScript. Understanding how to work with asynchronous code and callbacks was a bit of a struggle for me at first. It all started to click for me. It was a challenging lesson, but it was also incredibly rewarding once I was able to grasp the concepts and apply them in my own projects.
                
                I also really enjoyed learning about CSS animations and transitions. It was fascinating to see how I could bring elements on a webpage to life with just a few lines of CSS. Understanding how to use keyframes, easing functions, and transform properties allowed me to create more engaging and dynamic user interfaces.
 
                Overall, while these lessons were initially challenging, they ultimately helped me become a more well-rounded developer and gave me the tools to create more interactive and visually appealing web applications. </p1>
